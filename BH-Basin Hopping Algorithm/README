scipy.optimize.basinhopping

Basin-hopping is a two-phase method that combines a global stepping algorithm with local minimization at each step.
Designed to mimic the natural process of energy minimization of clusters of atoms.
It works well for similar problems with “funnel-like, but rugged” energy landscapes
