For non-stiff problems: 'RK45', 'RK23'
For stiff problems: 'Radau', 'BDF'
If not sure: first try to run ‘RK45’. If needs unusually many iterations, diverges, or fails, 
             it's likely to be stiff and you should use ‘Radau’ or ‘BDF’.
             'LSODA' can be a good universal choice, but it might be somewhat less convenient to work with as it wraps old Fortran code.

一、Python--version
  1.scioy.integrate.odeint (Old API)
    ---Integrate a system of ordinary differential equations.
    ---Solves the initial value problem for stiff or non-stiff systems of first order ode-s:
    ---** dy/dt = func(y, t0, ...) **  (where y can be a vector).
  
  2.scipy.integrate.solve_ivp
    ---Solve an initial value problem for a system of ODEs.
    ---This function numerically integrates a system of ordinary differential equations given an initial value:
    ---** dy / dt = f(t, y), y(t0) = y0 **
